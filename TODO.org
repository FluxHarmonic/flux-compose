#+title: Task List

Here's a list of tasks we've come up with while coding on the project:

* Interface

** TODO Don't show Guile Scheme banner when starting =flux-compose=
** TODO Make =init.scm= loading more tolerant to process start location (cwd)
** TODO Don't use a brittle relative path to load =libflux.so=

* Graphics

** TODO Use fragment shaders for drawing and effects
