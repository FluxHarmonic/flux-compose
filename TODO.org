#+title: Task List

Here's a list of tasks we've come up with while coding on the project:

* Interface

** TODO Don't show Guile Scheme banner when starting =flux-compose=
** TODO Make =init.scm= loading more tolerant to process start location (cwd)
** TODO Don't use a brittle relative path to load =libflux.so=

* Graphics

** TODO Use fragment shaders for drawing and effects

* Milestones

** Render basic video thumbnails from input script files

** Develop algorithms for generating interesting thumbnail styles (and other graphics)

** Create animations that can be rendered to video files, used in stream overlays

** Write basic audio system with a basic audio synthesizer

** Design scripting patterns for writing songs with an audio timeline

** Develop a set of synthesizers and effects that can be used for more interesting music and sound effects

** Integrate video editing capabilities
